        		<h1>Goals of the project</h1>
				<p>The goal for this app is to connect prospective employees with company mentors to train them up for the interview process. </p>
				<h2>Forum</h2>
				<p>Here we wanted the user to be able to post general questions to other users of the app to find answers as quickly as possible.  Perhaps someone would want to know what type of salary a company tends to have, and this would allow them to pose that question, and receive many answers across the board to get a general idea. </p>
				<h2>Current Mentors</h2>
				<p>This section is the main heart of the app goal, which is where the connections users have made to their prospective mentors show up.  This allows them to review  these connections, and reach out to them specifically for further tutelage or questions.</p>
				<h2>Scout</h2>
				<p>This is the other main piece of functionality, where users can search the available mentors and request permission to connect with them. </p>
				<h2>Settings</h2>
				<p>General app settings such as setting up a profile and revealing your account as searchable are done here. </p>
